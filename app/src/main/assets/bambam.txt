You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfing now
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now, mmm
Couldn't never imagine even having doubts
But not everything works out, no
Now I'm out dancing with strangers
You could be casually dating
Damn, it's all changing so fast
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around and it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standing, but now I'm dancing
He's all over me (goza)
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam (así es la vida)
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (uh, huh)
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (eh, eh, uh, huh)
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (uh, huh)
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam
It's been a hell of a year, thank God we made it out
Yeah, we were riding a wave and trying not to drown
And on the surface, I held it together
But underneath, I sorta came unwound
Where would I be? You're all that I need
My world, baby, you hold me down
You always hold me down
Well, I've been a breaker and broken
Every mistake turns to moments
Wouldn't take anything back
Así es la vida, sí (así es)
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around and it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standing, but now I'm dancing
He's all over me (she's all over me)
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam (ay, ay)
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam (¡pónganle azúcar, mi gente!)
Y sigue bailando, hey
Y sigue bailando, a-ha (keep dancing, yeah)
Y sigue bailando (keep dancing, yeah)
Y sigue bailando, a-ha (hey)
Y sigue bailando (hay amor en todos lados)
(Keep dancing, yeah)
Y sigue bailando (hay amor en todos lados)
Y sigue bailando, woah (sigue, sigue, sigue bailando)
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around and it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standing, but now I'm dancing
He's all over me (she's all over me)
Now I, now I'm dancing (keep dancing, yeah)
Now I, now I'm dancing (keep dancing, yeah)
Now I, now I'm dancing (keep dancing, yeah)
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
And now I'm dancing (keep dancing, yeah)
Now I'm dancing (keep dancing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam)

(Y te da vida)
(Hey, hey)
(Así es la vida)
(Y te da vida)
