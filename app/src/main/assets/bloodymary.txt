Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone I'll tell them my religion's you
When Pontius come to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones.
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands,
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus, said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands,
Hands above my head
Dance together
Forgive him before he's dead because
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see
When you're gone I'll still be bloody Mary
(Scream)
We are not just art for Michaelangelo
To carve. He can't rewrite the agro of my furied,
Heart. I'll wait On mountain tops in Paris cold
Je ne veux pas mourire toute seule
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands,
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus, said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands,
Hands above my head
Dance together
Forgive him before he's dead because
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do do do
I won't cry for you, see
When you're gone I'll still be bloody Mary
(Scream)
